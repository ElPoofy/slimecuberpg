I do not really know how GitHub works, but I added all of the code for the browser "RPG" here. 
All you should really have to do is put everything in a folder, right click the html file, and open in the browser of your choice (I have tested it in OperaGX and Google Chrome, and it functioned in both). 

GAMEPLAY:
Right now, you play the game by colliding with one of the 4 other slimes that spawn randomly after you start a new game. Currently, the player can defeat the Blue Slime, and after, with their upgraded stats, they can defeat the orange slime. The Black and White slimes are currently not defeatable even with blue/orange slimes absorbed. (Because of this, I also plan on making it so more of the blue/orange slimes spawn). My overall goal would be for the randomly spawning slimes to be for "farming stats", and then maybe add unique boss enemies that the player could challenge that have predetermined spawn points. 

Current bugs:
-When the player loses, it will keep giving the game over or you win message a ton of different times unless you refresh the page. Everytime I tried to fix it it just made things worse so I reverted for now.
-Slimes sometimes spawn a bit outside the borders of the screen, making the map "larger" then anticipated sometimes (forcing player to scroll outside of base map). They are still reachable however. 

Future planned implementations (I don't know if any of this will happen unless it's just for experimentation - if I want to make an actual game I don't think I'll use this method again o-o)
-Multiple of each enemy (right now the player cannot actually defeat the white/black slimes. So more slimes would be needed to gain more stats). 
-Add some form of background, maybe add specific spawnings for different types of enemies based on that background.
-Add varying enemy types (maybe do some more research on importing/using different images on the internet.
-Add enemy dialogue, and an option for players if they want to actually fight the enemy or not.
-Add enemy names (in dialogue). 
-Save/Load system (would replace the exit game button seeing as that is completely pointless). 
-Point system for each enemy you defeat, to allow you to purchase permanent upgrades on the main menu.
-Additional regions/enemies.
